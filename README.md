# show_contacts
PyMOL Plugin for displaying polar contacts.  Good hydrogen bonds (as determined by PyMOL) are shown in yellow.  Electrostatic clashes (donor-donor or acceptor-acceptor) are shown in red.  Close (<4.0 A) but not ideal contacts are shown in purple.  Cutoffs are configurable.  Exports the command `contacts` which takes two selections and an optional name for the generated contacts group.  Alternatively, the selections can be chosen using a dialog box accessible from the Plugins menu.
